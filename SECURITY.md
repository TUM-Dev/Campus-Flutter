## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report any and all security vulnerabilitys you found, or you think you found at app (at-symbol) tum.de .  
We will diagnose the issue internally and propose a fix.
The timeline of a fix depends on how severe the problem is and what impacts it has.
As a reward for reporting such vulnerabilitys you can get exclusive stickers or other small things.
